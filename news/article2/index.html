        <p>His Excellency, Jayden Riley V. Dagsa, President of the Republic of Jayditaria, gave his remarks on the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the 46th President and 49th Vice-President of the United States, in a statement today.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Dear people of our great Republic,</b>
            <br>
            Today, we witness the power of American democracy. The peaceful swearing-in of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Vice-President Kamala D. Harris
            prove to us all that America is still the great dignified and shining beacon of democracy we all know and love. It is a showing that democracy prevailed, even in the midst of deep division along party lines.<br>
            <br>
            I wish the new President, the First Lady, the Vice-President, and the Second Gentleman well on their new roles.<br>
            <br>
            May the inauguration of President Biden and Vice-President Harris be an inspiration to all of us, to cherish our liberty. May we commit ourselves to that unfinished work that is democracy.<br>
            <br>
            May God bless our Republic and the United States of America.
